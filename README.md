Welcome to this introductory blog post. I am a almost full time amatauer training ninja nerd assassin (jiu jitsu) and starbucks barista trying to learn to this programming thing. Its gnarly how deep this rabbit hole goes and im very intrigued to begin my ventures here. I was largely attracted by the freedom i saw in doing freelance work in front-end web-dev. I would very much like to be able to do work from a laptop in between training sessions and classes to pay bills so I eventually don't have to slave away as a barista. The more I learn the more I do not want confine my learning to the parameters of building websites as a side-gig. Oh I really like cold brew iced coffees.
